## Habits I'm working on

- After I **sit down at my desk**, I will **open my scriptures**.
- After I **read my scriptures**, I will **open Code Complete**.
- After I **get up early (before 7:00)**, I get to **work on my website for 30 minutes**.
- After I **get in bed early (before 11:00)**, I get to **read Harry Potter for up to 30 minutes**.

## Habits I Want to Build

- Going to bed early/getting up early
- Read a little bit of _Code Complete_ every day
- Stretching to increase hamstring flexibility
- Writing _some_ code every day on a side project

## Habits I Want to Break

- Getting my phone and bringing it back to bed when my alarm goes off
- Using my phone while in bed in the morning

  - Premeditate cues and rewards.
  - Decide beforehand, when you're cold-blooded, so that you don't have to make a decision when you're hot-blooded.
- _Atomic Habits_
- _The Power of Habit_
- The Temptation of Christ ([Matt. 4:1–11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4?lang=eng); [Luke 4:1–13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/4?lang=eng))
  - Jesus was able to withstand temptation when He was hot-blooded (starving from fasting) partly because He had predetermined how He would respond to such temptations by mastering principles in scripture.
  - In a similar way, we can pretermine how we'll respond when cues nag us to participate in habits we want to break.
