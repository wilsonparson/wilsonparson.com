## Does anyone actually do true agile?

- "We do agile but modify it to work comfortably for our team"
- User stories vs developer stories (i.e. tasks)
- Misunderstanding the purpose of epics
- Never using subtasks
- It's hard to write user stories, but it's worth it
  - Clearer for QA
  - Deliverable demo by end of sprint
  - Project is always in "working condition"
  - Why should QA be responsible for testing tasks (i.e., endpoints)
  - Easier to think about myself than about the user
  - User stories are not just to-do items
- Paradox of ERDs + agile
  - ERD informs story creation, adds rigidity
  - Work is prioritized from the ERD's perspective, not from the product owner's
  - Do some agile teams not have ERDs?
  - Do they just constantly refactor?
  - When do they make architectural decisions?
- It's harmful to say you do agile but not actually do it
  - No one agrees on how to organize work
  - There's no standard to rally around
  - Every team within the organization organizes work very differently
  - Team members start thinking that what their team does is true agile
