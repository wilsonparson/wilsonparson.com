## Why did the animators depict the land with sheer cliffs and uneven spots, as if there was an earthquake?

According to the [The Making of Disney's Sleeping Beauty (around 9:32-14:00)](https://youtu.be/D5uFGv45XEw), the background artist, Eyvind Earle, studied and mimicked medieval, Gothic, proto-Rennaisance art because of the temporal setting of the story itself. One of the principal influences Earle cited in his artistic direction for the film was the [Book of Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours). Earle channeled those influences into a modern style with "strong verticals" (12:30), which actually carried over even into how the animation team portrayed the film's characters (i.e., Aurora, King Stephan, Maleficent).
