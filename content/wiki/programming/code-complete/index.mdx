## Steps in designing objects (p. 87)

- Identify the objects and their attributes (methods and data).
- Determine what can be done to each object.
- Determine what can each object is allowed to do to other objects.
- Determine the parts of each object that will be visible to other objects—which parts will be public and which will be private.
- Define each object's public interface

> Abstraction is the ability to engage with a concept while safely ignoring some of its details—handling different details at different levels (p. 89).

> Encapsulation helps to manage complexity by forbidding you to look at the complexity (p. 90).
