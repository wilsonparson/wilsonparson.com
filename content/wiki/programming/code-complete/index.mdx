## 5.3 Design Building Blocks: Heuristics

### Steps in designing objects (p. 87)

- Identify the objects and their attributes (methods and data).
- Determine what can be done to each object.
- Determine what can each object is allowed to do to other objects.
- Determine the parts of each object that will be visible to other objects—which parts will be public and which will be private.
- Define each object's public interface

> Abstraction is the ability to engage with a concept while safely ignoring some of its details—handling different details at different levels (p. 89).

> Encapsulation helps to manage complexity by forbidding you to look at the complexity (p. 90).

### Hide Secrets (Information Hiding)

Two reasons to hide information (p. 94):

1. Hiding **complexity** so that your brain doesn't have to deal with it unless you're specifically concerned with it.
2. Hiding **sources of change** so that when change occurs, the effects are localized.

> Minor changes to a system might affect several routines within a class, but they should not ripple beyond the class interface (p. 93).

> The interface to a class should reveal as little as possible about its inner workings (p. 94).

> Hiding a design decision makes a huge difference in the amount of code affected by a change (p. 95).

> While the road to programming hell is paved with global variables, class data presents far fewer risks (p. 95).

> Get into the habit of asking, "What should I hide?" You'll be surprised at how many difficult design issues dissolve before your eyes (p. 97).
