I've spent the last several years starting, stopping, and restarting the process of building my own blog. I have spent at least 100 hours researching and learning different technologies, including Gatsby.js, Hugo, Hashnode, Medium, Wordpress, and Eleventy, all without building anything substantial. I've gone weeks agonizing over what to use for styling my blog, reading the docs for theme-ui, styled-system, rebass, styled-components, and tailwindcss, all without building anything substantial. What's so hilarious about this is I've managed to take what should be one of the least complex projects and made it so complex that I couldn't even start building it.

- Watched a ton of videos about overengineering and realized that they all describe me
- I wanted the blog to be an opportunity to learn a tool that is in demand, Gatsby.js, but I think I've learned an even more important lesson about overengineering in software. I always want to use the latest technologies and follow best practices, and I always focus more on the actual code than on the value it's supposed to deliver. I need to change that. I need to focus on delivering value and solving the problem.
- My regular forrays into Vim are another example of overengineering. It's the idea of, "Coding is getting boring. How can I make it harder?" I know that on paper Vim is a simple, low-level text editor without all the bells and whistles, but people are kidding themselves if they think they're simplifying their development process by writing hundreds of lines of configuration.
