    <p>During my last six months working at Earnest, I worked as the Team Lead on Earnest’s <em>Design Systems Team</em>, a brand new team that I pushed for us to create shortly after our new Head of Design joined the company. Our goal was to build a brand new design system, called <em>Nucleus</em>, that would replace the previous two design systems at Earnest, <em>Oahu</em> and <em>Maui</em>.</p>
<p>Our team had me, another front-end engineer, and a visual designer. While we didn’t get nearly as far building the design system as I had hoped before my time was up, we <em>were</em> able to lay a decent foundation, and I personally learned and grew from the experience.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of the lessons I learned building <em>Nucleus</em> between February and September of 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove your ego</li>
<li>Don’t build everything from scratch</li>
<li>Use stuff that is already built</li>
<li>Just go with sensible defaults</li>
<li>Avoid analysis paralysis (waterfall)</li>
<li>Work with a team to test things out early, but keep your expectations low for output</li>
<li>You won’t get it right the first time, so do the first time as soon as possible rather than delaying it out of fear of getting it wrong
<ul>
<li>Could quote <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> about this idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure design systems engineers have empathy for the consumers of the system.
<ul>
<li>“They’re using it wrong. I don’t know why they would do it that way.”</li>
<li>“This component is done.” (no testing, documentation or even stories)</li>
<li>Not being willing to test your own work</li>
<li>Blame-shifting: “No one ever told me this was a pain point.”</li>
<li>Lazy API design:
<ul>
<li>“They could always just override it.”</li>
<li>“It’ll just work with global styles as long as the designer does it right.”</li>
<li>If they want to render an H1 variant as a <code>&#x3C;p></code> tag, they’ll be SOL. (not willing to reset user agent styles)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get real</li>
<li>Avoid over-optimism and over-simplification
<ul>
<li>“Why do we need to build spacing utilities? They just need components.”</li>
<li>It won’t be right the first time. It won’t.</li>
<li>It won’t “just work” with global styles, and without spacing utilities and guardrails.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just can’t get over how much more flow I feel when I can write in markdown without restriction. I’ve given Wordpress a try, and it just feels too clunky to get my thoughts down. I’ve tried to remember that just because I know how to code doesn’t mean that everything has to be coded. But when you get used to the speed and simplicity of writing in a text editor, it’s so hard to go back. I really wanted to find a solution that would allow me to edit posts and publish them on my phone. I don’t know if I can find that if I do a markdown blog…</p>
<p>I guess I technically could use <em>Working Copy</em>…</p>
