## Chapter 1: The Essentialist

- Less, but better.
- Pause constantly to ask, "Am I investing in the right activities?"
- Live by design, not default.
- Figure out where your highest point of contribution lies, and then design your life so that executing it is almost effortless.
- If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.
- The word _priority_ was introduced in the 1400s, and didn't have a plural form until the 1900s. You can't have two first things.
- Common deathbed regret: "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
- It's not enough to identify which activities are your highest contributions. You also have to actively eliminate everything else.
- You need a system to make essentialism as effortless as possible. Perhaps a checklist.
- Analogy: your life = your closet.
- Discerning trivial many from vital few. Ask these three questions:
  1. "What do I feel deeply inspired by?"
  2. "What am I particularly talented at?"
  3. "What meets a significant need in the world?"

### Chapter 7: Play: Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child

- Play = anything that we do simply for the joy of doing rather than as a means to an end.
- Play is important not just as an antidote to stress. It also boosts creativity.
- Mine your past for play memories. Do what you loved doing as a child.
- Non-essentialists think that play is trivial. It's not.
