  * 2021-06-12: This morning I was reading _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ to Nora and as I was teaching her new vocabulary, I realized that teaching is definitely one of my talents, and it has been ever since my mission. It's why I was a good teacher at the MTC, and why I looked into becoming a professor or studying instructional technology. Teaching, in some ways, is just the act of clearly communicating an idea in a way that is understandable for your particular audience. And in that sense, I already do teaching at work often. It makes me want to do it more, and now, more than ever, I am inspired to start a blog to teach leadership skills in tech.
