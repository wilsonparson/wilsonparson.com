## Chapter 1: The Essentialist

* Less, but better.
* Pause constantly to ask, "Am I investing in the right activities?"
* Live by design, not default.
* Figure out where your highest point of contribution lies, and then design your life so that executing it is almost effortless.
* If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.
* The word _priority_ was introduced in the 1400s, and didn't have a plural form until the 1900s. You can't have two first things.
* Common deathbed regret: "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
* It's not enough to identify which activities are your highest contributions. You also have to actively eliminate everything else.
* You need a system to make essentialism as effortless as possible. Perhaps a checklist.
* Analogy: your life = your closet.
* Discerning trivial many from vital few. Ask [these three questions](three-questions.md):
  1. "What do I feel deeply inspired by?"
  2. "What am I particularly talented at?"
  3. "What meets a significant need in the world?"

### Steps of Essentialism (also parts of this book)

1. Explore: discerning the trivial many from the vital few
2. Eliminate: cutting out the trivial many
3. Execute: removing obstacles and making execution effortless

## Part I: Essence: What is the core mind-set of an essentialist?

Three assumptions we need to conquer:

1. "I have to"
2. "It's all important"
3. "I can do both"

Need to replace these with:

1. "I choose to"
2. "Only a few things really matter"
3. "I can do anything but not everything"

### Chapter 2: Choose: The Invincible Power of Choice

* "If you decide to stay in the US..."
* It wasn't that he had decided that law school was the only option. It was that he had decided that no law school was _not_ an option.
* He had chosen law school not because he wanted to be there, but by _default_.
* If we surrender our ability to choose, something or someone else will choose for us.
* We may not always be in control of our options, but we can always control how we choose among them.
* Don't blindly follow a path prescribed by another person.

## Part II: Explore: How can we discern the trivial many from the vital few?

### Chapter 7: Play: Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child

* Play = anything that we do simply for the joy of doing rather than as a means to an end.
* Play is important not just as an antidote to stress. It also boosts creativity.
* Mine your past for play memories. Do what you loved doing as a child.
* Non-essentialists think that play is trivial. It's not.
