## Ujjayi Breathing

- Breathe in through your nose and constrict your throat to make a slight snoring or "ocean" sound.
- Helps you to focus more on your breath.

Match your inhale time to your exhale time.

Exhale when you stretch; inhale when you relax.

Push your organs into your pelvic floor to help elongate your spin and improve your posture. Keep your core engaged when you're sitting to maintain posture.
