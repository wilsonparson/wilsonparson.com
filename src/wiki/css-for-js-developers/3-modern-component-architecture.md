- For almost every component he creates using styled components, he usually calls the outermost element `Wrapper`.
- The `article` HTML element isn't just for blog our journal articles. It's for anything that could be independently shared or reused. Some examples:
  - Blog post
  - Forum post
  - Product card
  - User comment
  - Interactive widget or gadget
  - Any other independent item of content.
- For the contact card component we built, he used an `article` as the outermost element.
