title: Crazy, Not Grapes
---

_Talking about having a snack in the kitchen_

Nora: And I can have a drink and fruit? Like a grape?

Me: Uh, I don't think we have any grapes in the fridge.

Nora: _Realizing that she mistook cherries for grapes, but trying to recover_ No, I said, "Like **crazy** while I have cherries," because I wanted to act crazy while having my drink and cherries!
