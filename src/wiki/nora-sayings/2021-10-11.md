title: I was being like the whifflebird
---

_After Wilson suggested they go into Nora's room to make her bed, and she told him to stay in his bedroom with Greta._

Nora: "Come on, Daddy!"

Wilson: "You said you didn't want me to come into your room with you to make your bed."

Nora: _Getting emotional_ "No, I _did_ want you to come in with me. I didn't say that, but that's what I meant! I was being like the whifflebird, where I say something but I mean something else!"

> Note: The whifflebird is a creature from the book _The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles_ who says code words and the characters need to figure out what they mean.
