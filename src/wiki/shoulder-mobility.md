title: Shoulder Mobility

This is from [Day 1 - Scapula & Shoulder Mobility Lecture in Saturno Movement Calisthenics Journey](https://saturnomovement.com/topic/day-1-scapula-shoulder-mobility-lecture-relative-strength-test/).

## Exercises

These exercises are inspired by hand balancer Yuri Marmerstein.

With workout band wrapped around something at shoulder height...

- Rows
- Circular contractions
- Straight-arm depressions & contractions
- Just try a lot of different movements and rotations and see what feels tight
- Explore and experiment with your body; it might be different from day to day
- Find the pops and the clicks, and strengthen those areas
- Facing away from the bar, hold band over head (like skull crusher), and then flex serratus anterior to stretch it
- Also try a band wrapped around a bar overhead and do similar motions
- M T Y I (make these shapes with your arms)
- Don't arch your back


Do something like this before every workout.
