As we continue to get situated in our new house and unbox our items, I'm learning the importance of making sure that every thing I own has a home. I often think that the source of my clutter is laziness or lack of discipline, but I'm realizing that usually I don't put things away because I don't know _where_ to put them.

## An Example: School Assignments

For example, yesterday I was clearing some things off the counter, and I came across a school assignment my 6-year-old daughter had brought home. I stood there, staring dead-eyed down at the piece of paper in my hand, and _almost_ did what I usually do with these kinds of things: put it on the top of the pile of papers next to the fridge. It was then that I realized the reason I don't know what to do with it is because there isn't a place for it in our home.

So I looked up ideas on YouTube for storing kids' school assignments, and now we have a plan! We're going to hang a cork board or magnet board near our mudroom where we can display the girls' assignments and artwork until we decide on their final resting place. This will give the girls a chance to admire and enjoy their hard work, and will also help us not feel guilty about recycling some of it. After the assignments have been on the wall for a week or so, we'll decide whether to keep it long-term (hopefully a rare occasion), or whether to get rid of it.

## Takeaway

The lesson I'm taking from this is next time I don't know where to put something, I'm going to sit down and figure out how to make a home for it in our house.
