We recently moved, and I've been overwhelmed with organizing all the stuff we've acquired over the years. I've been researching tips for getting rid of stuff and organizing, the other day I came across this video on Swedish death cleaning.

In the video, the vlogger explains the idea that there are so many ways things make their way into our homes, but the only way things leave our homes is if we actively choose to get rid of them. As a result, if you don't regularly get rid of things, you will end up with more and more stuff overtime.

I often feel guilty getting rid of stuff, not because I think I should keep it, but because I acquired it in the first place. I've learned a lot about minimalism over the past few years, and I'm definitely more mindful about how much stuff I acquire. It can be discouraging having that mindset while at the same time realizing I need to keep getting rid of stuff. I often think, "What am I doing wrong?"

While watching the video it dawned on me that no matter how vigilant you are about what comes into your house, it's simply going to happen. It's a part of life. People give you things. Kids bring things home from school. Kids grow up and no longer care fit into their clothes or care about all of their toys. Things that are useful at this time in your life can become less useful as you get older.

There's no way around it. You are going to have to regularly get rid of stuff if you don't want it to clutter your life.
