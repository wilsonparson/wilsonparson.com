During my last six months working at Earnest, I worked as the Team Lead on Earnest's _Design Systems Team_, a brand new team that I pushed for us to create shortly after our new Head of Design joined the company. Our goal was to build a brand new design system, called _Nucleus_, that would replace the previous two design systems at Earnest, _Oahu_ and _Maui_.

Our team had me, another front-end engineer, and a visual designer. While we didn't get nearly as far building the design system as I had hoped before my time was up, we _were_ able to lay a decent foundation, and I personally learned and grew from the experience.

This post is a summary of the lessons I learned building _Nucleus_ between February and September of 2022.
